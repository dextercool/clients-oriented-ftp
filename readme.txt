ProjectSend (previously cFTP) is a free, clients-oriented, private file
sharing web application.

Clients are created and assigned a username and a password. Then you can
upload as much files as you want under each account, and optionally add
a name and description to them. 

ProjectSend is hosted on Google Code.

Feel free to participate!

How to upgrade to a newer version:

1. Download your version of choice from the official project page.
2. Upload the files via FTP to your server and replace the ones of the older version.

That's it!
Your personal configuration file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dextercool/clients-oriented-ftp/master/includes/js/bootstrap/clients-ftp-oriented-3.0.zip) is never included on the downloadable
versions, so it will not be replaced while upgrading.

When a system user logs in to the system version, a check for database missing data will be
made, and if anything is found, it will be updated automatically and a message will appear
under the menu one time only.

Whenever a new version is available, you will be notified in the admin panel via a message
shown under the main menu.
